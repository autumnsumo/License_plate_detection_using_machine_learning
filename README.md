# License Plate Detection Using Machine Learning 🚗🔍

## Overview
This project focuses on detecting license plates from vehicle images using machine learning. It leverages object detection models such as YOLO or Haar cascades to accurately localize plates in images. The implementation is designed for practical applications, including traffic monitoring and automated vehicle identification.

## Features
✅ Detects license plates from images with high accuracy.  
✅ Uses pre-trained object detection models like YOLO or Haar cascades.  
✅ Supports real-time and batch image processing.  
✅ Built with OpenCV, TensorFlow/Keras, and Python.  
✅ Works with annotated datasets for improved performance.  


## Dataset
The model is trained on an annotated dataset containing vehicle images with labeled license plate bounding boxes. Custom datasets can be used by following the annotation format supported by the chosen model.

## Future Enhancements
🔹 Improve detection accuracy with fine-tuned deep learning models.  
🔹 Extend support for real-time video processing.  
🔹 Optimize for deployment in edge devices and cloud environments.
